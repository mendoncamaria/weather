# Weather Forecast Website

This project is my personal favourite. This was the first project I integrated Public API and handled response in the UI. Please note:
Multiple values are hardcoded for UI Design purpose.

## About the Project

### Overview:
On Landing, the website will first fetch your location (if enabled in browser) and give forecast for the same. There are two views:
1. Laptop Dashboard - This is divided into two sections - Left hand side is the dashboard and Right Hand side is the forecast.
2. Only Weather Updates - This is available only in mobile view.

### Tech Stack
ReactJS + Vite

### External Libraries
1. styled-components: For styling the components and page
2. react-icons: For displaying icons in the UI
3. axios: For API call and handling
<!-- 4.  -->

### Deployment Platform
Vercel
